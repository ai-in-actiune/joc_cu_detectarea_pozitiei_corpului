# AR Fighter

---

## Description

Welcome to AR Fighter, an innovative and immersive Player versus Player (PvP) game that takes gaming to a whole new level. In AR Fighter, both players will use their body parts as controllers, leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology to create a unique and physically engaging gaming experience. 

## Game Overview

AR Fighter is not your typical PvP game. It combines the excitement of head-to-head competition with the physicality of gesture-based controls, all through the lens of your device's camera. Players will use their own bodies as controllers, moving, dodging, and striking to outmaneuver and defeat their opponent.
